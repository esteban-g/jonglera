Managing stress and cognition in stress-related disorders: Jonglera, a digital coach for a sustainable life

Research project In order to provide individuals instruments for managing stress and cognition in stress-related disorders, an AI-based digital companion, or coach is being developed in a collaboration between UmeÃ¥ University, Karlstad University and the stress rehabilitation clinic at the VÃ¤sterbotten County Council.

Jonglera has three main services: 1) track physical activities using internal sensors; 2) manage activities during your day (calendar and list activities); and 3) define your main goals.

## Architecture

Jonglera is an agent-based platform with three main components or nodes: 1) the mobile node (this GitHub software), which contains different modules to display user information, modules for input/output exchange, for getting data form internal sensors of the mobile phone, and a module for storing information; 2) a server node, where our agent platform and  an argumentation system run (provided by servers in the Department of Computing Science at UmeÃ¥ university); and 3) a knowledge repository node, which is an ontology-based repository (http://acktus.cs.umu.se) for obtaining, updating, storing user information.

### User

The `User` provider is used to authenticate users through its
`login(accountInfo)` and `signup(accountInfo)` methods, which perform `POST`
requests to an API endpoint that you will need to configure.

### Api

The `Api` provider is a simple CRUD frontend to an API. Simply put the root of
your API url in the Api class and call get/post/put/patch/delete
